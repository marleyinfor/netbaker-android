Why this?

GPL introduces the obligation to distribute the source code of your own software. The intention is good, but represents a problem for software companies and
independent software authors: distribute their product's source code. We think that proprietary products are a legal form of distributing software, and it is
the right of the author.

LGPL may be the best choise to preserve our rights and give you the freedom to create other products.

This software's license is BASED on LGPL, but have some additions, which you MUST follow. 

In case of any questions, please feel free to contact the authors.
